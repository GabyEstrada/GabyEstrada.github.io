# "From Boardroom to Classroom" by Michael S. Peterson

Lately, I‚Äôve been exploring new ways to give back to my community, and it got me thinking about my time in school. Some of my professors worked part-time, which allowed them to teach night classes and share their real-time experiences with us. Inspired by that, I decided to bring up the idea to one of my former professors, and he recommended I read his book, which dives into this topic.

These are some things I want to remember:

- You don‚Äôt need a PhD to teach so long as you have the necessary experience
- If you are serious about changing careers to teaching at the college level full-time, consider doing the AACSB Bridge Program
    - The program is less than a week long
- When teaching, show how much you love what you‚Äôre doing, and it‚Äôll spread through the room. Engage the students with stories, questions, and discussions.
- Ideas on things to try if you want to get your foot in the door:
  - Be a guest lecturer
  - Become a student mentor
  - Judge business plan competitions
  - Participate in mock interviews to help college students
  - Consider writing/collaborating with professors to write a case
  - Fundraise (Ex. Kendra Scott)
  - Join a formal board of alumni and executives to help advise and provide support
  - AACSB credentials
- Note to self: Revisit the book on ideas for how to keep students engaged

Personally, my goal is to try becoming a guest lecturer at the college where I‚Äôm already volunteering to see if it‚Äôs something I enjoy.

If you‚Äôre considering becoming a professor, whether part-time or full-time, I recommend checking out this book on Amazon‚Äîit‚Äôs a great resource to get started! ‚òïüç©
