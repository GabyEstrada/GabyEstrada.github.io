# The 5 steps I took to Secure a Job in Less than 90 days

This guide is based on my personal experience and the proven techniques that helped me succeed in my job search. Let me walk you through the steps that can help you achieve similar results.☺️

## 1. Perfecting Your Resume
Your resume is your first impression on potential employers. Here’s how I made my shine:

- Header: Include your LinkedIn profile address.
- Education: Place it at the bottom if you have more than 3 years of experience, or at the beginning if you’re a recent graduate or have 1-2 years of experience.
- Experience: Use action verbs, describe what you did, how/why you did it, and the results for every bullet point. Quantify your achievements when possible and put your most impressive bullet point at the top.
- Projects: Consider including this section if you’re in engineering, UI/UX, creative, or consulting roles.
- Community Involvement: Highlight volunteer work or church activities, etc.
- Extra Sections: Consider adding hobbies, tools you’re proficient in, and languages you speak.

## 2. Optimizing Your LinkedIn Profile
Think of LinkedIn as your digital resume. To make it stand out:

- Optimize your bio. Think of your first paragraph as a 10 second elevator pitch. Tell people who you are, what you do, and how you can help. These can be short and nice paragraphs while writing in first person.
- Consider getting recommendations (optional but beneficial).

## 3. Streamlining Your Job Search
Stay organized and efficient in your job hunt:

- Use a simple excel Job Tracker to keep tabs on your applications.
- Utilize email templates to save time and maintain professionalism during every step of the hiring process.

## 4. Acing the Interview Process
Prepare for interviews at every stage by practicing common questions and scenarios.

## 5. Mastering Salary Negotiation
When you receive an offer, follow these tips:

- Don’t accept immediately. Express excitement and ask to review the offer via email.
- Take a day to consider, then schedule a call.
- Negotiate a 5-10k increase in salary (if appropriate).
- If a higher salary isn’t possible, consider negotiating for bonuses, additional time off, or other incentives like supplies, education budget, or extra vacation days.

With dedication and the right strategy, you’ll be well on your way to landing your ideal position in the tech industry!
