# What I learned from Vanessa Van Edwards

If you do not want to smile, do not force it. What you can do is put your finger in between teeth and see how your face looks (should be a little more cheerful) and then be concious to have that face from eyes and cheeks even if you are not showing teeth.
The most "popular" likeable people tend to have one thing in common: they have the longest list of people they like. They do sporatic moments of "hi, x how are you doing"
Three secrets to get people to like you more:
1) "I was thinking of you" "I saw this and reminded me of you.. how are you"
2)   - if you are not thinking of them, you do not need them in your life (bold statement)
  - how to use it genuinely every time you think of that person... do it like text or call them
