# "No Such Thing As Over-Exposure" by Robert Slater

I was in the library looking for another biography when I came across this book. The title got my attention. 
It was interesting to see a young Donald Trump on the front cover, way before he became President, and how the past was already alluding to his current popularity across the world.

### The key takeaways/reminders after reading this book are the following:
- Move forward if your gut is telling you "you have a great idea" even when everybody says it won't work. Trump's iconic branding of glass walls
and flashy/extravagant decor in his properties is part of his unique branding... people thought he was nuts.
- You have to promote yourself and let everyone know your successes. Trump uses every opportunity to do so.
- Trump literally practices and believes in over-exposure... you need to read the book to understand what I mean
- Even in difficult situations try to find a way to make a come-back. Don't give up. Your perspective on situations has a big influence.
- Be positive, realistic, and not optimistic. Work to make the change.

Feel free to grab a copy and read this interesting book.

Cheers,

Gaby
