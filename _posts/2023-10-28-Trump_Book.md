# "No Such Thing As Over-Exposure" by Robert Slater

I was in the library looking for another biography when I came across this book. The title got my attention. 
It was interesting to see how Donald Trump was before he became president and how the past was already alluding to his currently popularity 
across the world.

The keytakeways/reminders after reading this book are the following:
- Move forward if your gut is telling you you have a great idea, even when everybody says it won't work. Trump's iconinc branding of glass walls
and flashy/extravagant decor in his proporties is part of his unique branding... people though he was nuts.
- You have to promote yourself, let everyone know your successes. Trump uses every opportunity to do so.
- Trump literally practices and believes in over-exposure... you need to read the book to see what I mean
- Even in difficult situations try to find a way to make a come-back. Don't give up. Your perspective on situtions has a big influence. Be positive,
realistic, and not optimistic. Work to make the change.

Feel free to grab a copy and read this interesing book.

Cheers,
Gaby
