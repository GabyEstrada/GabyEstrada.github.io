# How to Make Great YouTube Shorts According to Jenni Hoyos

Beware that you need to customize this for your audience, so its helpful to take the following advice but definitely understand who is your audience.
1. A lot of others have said the same thing but is critical to do this thing of "trial and error" but in high quantities. What I mean for shorts, is to produce massive amounts of them in a short period of time to learn quicker, in the process you can test theories, styles, and learn more about your audience.
2. For short strategy, have a thumbnail, foreshadowing (through visual and audio), while keeping in mind that every single minute counts... so be strategic of what to say)
3. I liked that she invested a lot of time analyzing and also "stealing" styles to then find her own which prompted to be successful and become viral

These are the top things I got from the interview: Meet the YouTuber Who Solved Shorts (Jenny Hoyos Interview) - YouTube. My goal is not to be a famous YouTuber but since I've decided to use YouTube as my main channel for my business marketing, I should try to do things right so that the knowledge I share reaches and helps as many people as possible.
