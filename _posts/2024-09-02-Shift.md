# Shift by Peter Arnerll

The introduction of this book got me hooked! Peter’s personal story captivated me not only in the introduction but throughout the entire book

Here are the top takeaways I’ll remember:

Adding Value vs. Competing on Price:
Sergio from New York: “You can only win by having the lowest price or by giving the most value. I won’t lower my price, so I have to give more value.”
Embrace Change:
To truly embrace change, we must break through the barrier of fear and push ourselves toward self-discovery.
Going Tiger:
Being a tiger means getting out of your rut, stepping off the treadmill, and doing what’s natural—what you know you need to do to help yourself.
Going Helium:
Going helium isn’t about reaching the status quo; it’s about creating a new status quo that surpasses others’ imaginations.
Example: JFK’s moon project.
When you go helium, you laugh at the idea of failure.
Perception and Support:
As you go helium or go tiger, be aware of how others see you but stop worrying about their opinions.
Ensure you have a “fan club” to encourage and support your efforts.
Shock and Awe:
If you’re embarking on a significant personal change, when you’re ready, go for shock and awe.
Embrace Mistakes:
Learning to embrace mistakes is another way of learning to love thinking differently.
Examples: Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers.
It’s a given that if you dare to make a major change, you’ll face some bad days. You might feel like you’ve made mistakes that have set you back, and maybe you have. Some mistakes can genuinely set you back, but most can be overcome.
Final Thoughts:

Cheers,
