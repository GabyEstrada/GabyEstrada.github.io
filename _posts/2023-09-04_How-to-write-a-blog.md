# How To Write A Blog According to Neil Patel

1. First thing you do is start off with a title
    - get inspiration from reading magazines, posts, articles
    - create two to three variations and ask people to choose 
2. Have a strong introduction by having a solid hook that also mentiones what you will cover in your post
   - a quick overview of what you are going to teach them
3. Body should have subheadings
   - want people to be able to skim your content
   - keep your paragraphs from fice to six lines max
4. Link out to other sites
   - build credibility
5. Wrap up with a conclusion
   - end with a question as it creates buzz
   - call it "Conclusion"
     
BONUS: reach out to those you back-link and let them know you did that.
