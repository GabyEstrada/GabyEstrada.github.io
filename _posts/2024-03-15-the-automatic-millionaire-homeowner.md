# The Automatic Millionaire Homeowner by David Bach

Amazing read! I wish this was a required book in college or something. Okay, getting down to what I learned:

- How much "home" can you afford? Most people can do 29% of their gross income on housing (aka mortgage pmts, property taxes, and other regular costs) and as
  much as 41% with no debts!
- Make savings automatic!
- If you are looking for a fast way to save for a home, the bottom line is that it's all about the small stuff
  - Latte Factor
  - Double Latte Factor
- FICO stands for Fair Isaac Corp.
- Get your credit report and make sure there are no mistakes... if so, submit a request to fix them
- Only consider fixer-upper properties that are at least 20% below prevailing market prices
- When closing, make sure you ask and read your HUD-1
- Interest on a mortgage for homeowners or real estate investors are tax-deductible (up to a certain amt)
- 1031 exchange (Starker Exchange) ... when you sell a rental property, don't have to pay taxes if proceeds go to another property within 180 days
- Easier to get a home-equity loan than a mortagage (for those with a house already)
    - Recommended to only use to buy more assets
- Have 6 months of emergency funds saved
- If buy a rental property, have 3 months of rent saved

Hope these small snippets motivate you to read the book. :)

Cheers,
Gaby
