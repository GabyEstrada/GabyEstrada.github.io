# Defining your ICP by Court Brady

Think.... "who do we serve best" using the ICP lens method

- Identify: Identify 10 customers that paid you substantially and your biz got them significant results using a repeatable system
- Clarify the trigger: Identify your ICP's exact moment of discomfort that transitions from "maybe" just a discomfort to "urgency".. "I have to get this fixed"
- Pint the path: Map your strategy to their journey. Do they google to get help? Is it an inboumd approach? Do they need to be educated first? Outbound?

  Other Notes:
  - ICP can evolve
  - "Segment" -> "Specialize" -> "service deeply"
    - Cycle of your biz and your client as you grow
   
    Cheers,
