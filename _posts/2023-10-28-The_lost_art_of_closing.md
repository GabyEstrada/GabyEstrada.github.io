# The Lost Art of Closing by Anthony Iannarino

It took me months to finally plow through this book. 
I ended up reading most of it in one seating while taking a Vonlane to San Antonio, Texas. 

THere are a few things that I grabbed from this book and thin is important to remember.
- Charge your worth. If your service or product is expensinve don't feel tempted to give a discount.. instead, defend your price. Tell
  your potential clients why you are charging more than competitors. It solodifies your reputation if you do it right.
- Disclose your price first then move on to the rest (goes hand-in-hand with the topic above) as it will show how committed is the lead and if they
-   they have the budget.
- After demonstration or client presentation, you potential client might finsihf by saying "This is good...
  we will get back to you in a couple of weeks", if you leave it this, you are loosing control of the deal. So do whatever you can to set a meeting
  questions and concerns:
    "Thank you so much. I feel very strongly that we are the right partner for you here, and I believe that no one else is going to produce
    the same results we will. As you look at other proposals, you may see different ideas that you like that may or may not work for you. Can
    we schedule a meeting to answer any questions and address anything else you need to know before you move forward?
- Three words for an agent of change: transformation, modification, and modernization
- Always project confidence (doctor example)
- Remember: if your prospetive client could producce the results they want without making some of the commitments they need to make, they would not
- need you or what you are selling.
- Anthony gives a lot of examples of language you can use, even possible scenerios and how to navigate them... such as " Can you share your concenrs with me
  so I can make sure this works for you?"
- Remember: Selling ius not something you do to someone. It is something you do for someone and with someone.
- Anthony provides good questions to test the "Commitments".. pages 202-203

If you are a sales person, some things might sound repetitive but they are a few golden nuggets. If you are new in sales, this book will
be a great read.

Cheers,
