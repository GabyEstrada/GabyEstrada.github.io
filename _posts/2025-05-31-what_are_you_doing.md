# What Are You Doing? by Paul Holbrook

This book is great... allowing me to think about time and activities from a different way.

Below are instructions from the author on how to maximize the time you have for purposeful things. 
Most wasted time is lost by accident through lack of planning

## Diary Detox is composed of three parts
1. The Initial Diary Detox
2. The Weekly Diary Detox
3. The Spot Diary Detox

## Diary Detox Categories
1. Doing [RED]: You are producing something or carrying out a task 
   Example: creating a document, sending an email, submitting an expense claim, necessary travel.
2. Monitoring [AMBER]:You're checking to see that things are as expected. 
   Example: having a 121 meeting to check on progress, reading a financial report, reviewing a document, attending a project review meeting, stocktaking
   Hint: Anytime you hear the words, checking, reviewing, looking over, keeping an eye on, or catching up, it's likely that MONITORING is in progress.
3. Floating [GREY]: You are not adding value or you're not sure what value you are adding AKA wasting time.
   Example: attending a meeting without being sure why you are there, writing a report that will never be read, traveling to a meeting that could be done via         video/telephone
4. Directing [AMBER]: You're giving instructions or assigning tasks. Is all about telling someone what needs to be done, providing exact instructions.
   Examples: demonstrating how something should be done, giving an order, giving permission
5. Thinking [GREEN]: You are taking time to think about vision, strategy, a plan or obstable to achieving them.
   Example: Considering vision or strategy, brainstorming with colleagues, being coached or mentored, going for a walk or taking exercise to ponder.
6. Communicating [GREEN]: You're meeting new people or sharing new ideas withing or outside the organization.
   Example: sharing your vision or strategy, sharing your ideas for improvement, networking within or outside your organization
7. Improving [GREEN]: You're learning, teaching, or enhancing your organization, what it does or who does it with.
   Example: teaching as part of a succession plan, learning a new skill, agreeing to make a positive change.
   Note: There is an important difference between teaching (IMPROVING) and instruction (DIRECTING). Teaching is explaining the desired outcome, explaining why 
   it's important, and participating in a discussion as to how the outcome should be achieved. Instructing is showing someone how to do something by pointing out 
   each of the steps to achieving the desired outcome. The former is more impactful.

## Other Tips
- Set your working hours
- Set your 30,90, yearly targets (goals) and distill them into small action items that can be added to your weekly cal
- Each target should have a number assigned to it that range between 1 and 3.
  - 1: means that you are both accountable and responsible for the target and will do it yourself, because it's at the core of your role.
       Without such tasks, you wouldn't have a role.
  - 2: means you are responsible for that target and will do it yourself at the moment because there is no one else available who can be delegated to.
  - 3: means that you are accountable for the target and have delegated (or will delegate) responsibility and therefore won't do it yourself.
  - The higher you are in a position, the more you should be doing green activities and less "doing" activities.
    Ideally: 80% green (4 days a week), 20% amber (one day a week), and no red activities.
  - Habits take 66 days to form
  - Insert a weekly recurring appointment into your calendar called "Weekly diary detox" (MONITORING)

## Putting All into One
- Diary: 1. Ensure everything you did this week is in your diary 2. Ensure next week's commitments are in your diarys
- Evaluate: 1. Ensure this week's categories are still correct 2. Categorize all of next week's activities
- Target: 1. Review your TARGETS and change if necessary 2. Erase the ticks from the "Diary" column
- Opportunity: Tick or cross "In diary" for each target depending on whether present in next weeks diary
- x-change: In 1, 2, 3 order, insert an activity in your diary for each target with a cross and tick when inserted. 2. Reflect on your color mix against Roles Ratios 3. Fill the remaining space with "green" activities.
- Re-categorize as you finish an activity if it's different from what you expected.
- Insert activities you can predict in your ocming week:
  - Regular days off, lunch every day, travel to and from meetings, preparation and follow-up times for meetings, regular coffees/chats you tend to have.
- If an interruption appears and you are tempted to replace it... is the activity going to contribute to you achieving any of your Diary Deotc Targets?
  - Respond by either: 1. Doing it (now or later) 2. Delegating it 3. Not doing at all (explain to the person why and do this considerately).
