# Beautifully Organized At Work by Nikki Boyd

The last few years of working from home have shown me that self-discipline and a conducive environment are crucial for success. Nikki Boyd's book offers essential tips to stay organized, productive, and content whether you're working from home, the office, or on the go. 

### These are the top takeaways:
- Make a routine of the things you want to accomplish the day before and assign times to it
  - Sample routine: make bed (2 min), drink water (1 min), pray/journal (5 min), exercise (20 min), groom (20 min), shower (5-10 min), dress (10 min), eat (15 min)
  - Schedule the reocurring tasks on your calendar
- Prepare your outfit the day before
- Organize your bag: tech area (headphone and charger), suuplies pouch (pens, markers, hihglighters, etc.), planners and supplies, hygiene and makeup bag, eyeglasses/sunglasses case, side pockets (phone, keys, wallet, business cards), laptop bag, small purse
- Plan your breakfast the day before
- Invest in aromatherapy scents for your car
- Inspirational quotes in your desk/car
- Have a desk that is decluttered, organized, and clean (go for minimal, simple look)
- Only have the essentials at the top of your desk
- How to orgize your drawers: supplies (pens, notepads, etc.), technology (headphones, carging cords, etc.), and resources (calendars, stationery, and personal items)
- How to organize file cabinets: write of list of categories you need, color code them (i.e. red for clients, blue for vendors/supplies, green for company docs.), file items in their correct category
- Set up a place where you can put files that need to be organized and do it at end of day
- Beautify the space by adding plants, family photos, calmin scents, decor, and music
- Before leaving work: clean your tech. and empty trash, give yourself love (helps transition from work to personal time)
- Digital space: use a personalized wallpaper to keep your files organized in your desktop
- How to prioritize your day: set top 3 goals, break down your goals as to-do items, set aside focus time, create routines, when planning out tasks start with your most imp commitments, don't forget "me" time, evaluate your day
- If you wfh: mantain regular work hours, get dressed, schedule breaks, don't forget to socialize!

Initially, I was skeptical about the concept of an organizing business consultant, but after reading Nikki's book, I realized the importance of creating a personalized work environment. While my notes are quite high-level, I encourage you to read her book for a detailed guide on tailoring your workspace to your needs. :)

Cheers,
