# The Checklist Manifesto

During one internal meeting with my CEO, COO, and CS Director it was suggested among the team to read this book. If I had known that the next few months we were going to go
through all the stuff we went through, I would have read it sooner. Even though I ended up ordering 
and receiving it in my mailbox it took me a while to open it up. I just could not wrap my head around how so many pages could be devoted to talking about
checklists.

When I finally lifted the book and opened the pages, the intro got me hooked! Here are the top things that I took away:
- Try not to go to the hospital if you don't need to.... (read the book to understand what I mean üòù)
- The construction industry is safer for humans than the medical industry (annual failure rate of less than 0.00002%!)
- Even enhanced by technology, our physical and mental powers are limited. Two reasons we may nonetheless fail:
    - Ignorance
    - Ineptitude (not applying the knowledge we have consistently and correctly)
  - The aviation industry is the master when it comes to checklists!
  - Checklists help make sure simple steps are not missed or skipped and for communication to flow and resolve hard or unexpected problems
  - Good checklists have the following in common:
    - They are precise
    - They provide reminders of the most critical and important steps
    - They are practical
  - DISCIPLINE is key and it applies to individuals, companies, industries, etc.
  - Checklists have not been adopted widely across industries despite high amounts of research because of human pride that we don't need a paper to help us
  - Appendix: checklists for checklists ‚≠ê
 
  This book revolutionized how I think. In the last pages, it even gave examples of how investors used them. I understand now why the CEO was so eager for us to read it... it can be applied to so many things and create + change almost
  instantaneously. If you only have time for one book, opt for this one!

  Cheers,
