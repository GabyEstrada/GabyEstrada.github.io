# What I learned from Dickie Bush Regarding Bottlenecks + Content Generation.

I was hearing this podcast: How to Build a Business that Lets you Quit your Job â€“ Dickie Bush â€“ Deep Dive with Ali Abdaal | Podcast on Spotify. It has a lot of great information, but these were my main takeaways. ðŸ‘‡

## As you are growing your business:

- Identify your biggest bottleneck
- Then think how you can remove it

## Ways to get ideas for producing more content:

- Think what you have learned in the last two years
  - Personal example: Customer Success, running a startup
- Think what you want to learn in the next two years
  - Personal example: How to run a consulting business & an Etsy shop

Cheers,
