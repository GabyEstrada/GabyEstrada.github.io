## Relentless by Tim S. Grover with Shari Lesser Wenk


I stumbled upon this gem unexpectedly while perusing the library shelves, and curiously enough, I can't quite recall the specific section â€” perhaps the business aisle? 
Despite my usual preference for different genres, this particular book, though leaning heavily into the sports realm, proved to be an unexpected delight. 
The authors skillfully crafted a narrative that transcends sports expertise, making it accessible and engaging even for those without a deep knowledge of the subject.

What set this book apart was its refreshing lack of sugarcoating; it was refreshingly direct and to the point. 
Here are some key takeaways that left a lasting impression on me:

- find a way to always be in the Zone; Michael Jordan is a great example of this
- Get the best people around you, know your strenghts and weaknesses, and trust others to do what they do best. But in th end... your dreams are still your responsibility.
- To bring a thought to life... make a plan, and execute!
- Trust your guts, your instincts
- Every dream you imagine, everything you see and hear and feel in your sleep, that's not a fantasy, that's your deep instinct telling you it can all be real. Follow those visions and dream's and desires,
  and believe what you know. ONLY YOU can turn those dreams into reality. Never stop until you do.
- The greatest battles you wil ever fight are with yourself, and you must always be your toughest oppnonent
- Always demand more of yourself than others demand of you.
- Meet every challenge with confidence and the deep belief that you are prepared for anything.
- Be a Cleaner... walk with condidence, leave with results

  This is a great read. As always, feel free to check it out at your nearest bookstore!
