# Top Lessons from the book You, Inc. by the Beckwiths

This book is composed of great wisdom from a business couple. Below I will highlight the main things that got my attention. üëáüèª

- Life is not what you make it. It is how you take it.
- Make yourself uncomfortable
- To establish common ground, mimic your listener's pace
- A relationship starts with comfort
- Cut every document in half
- After you write something, be sure to hear it
- Build an authentic brand; there is no other kind
- Be yourself. For one thing, it is easier to remember and works dramatically better.
- Comparing yourself to others; you only see the part of the iceberg above the water
  - Alex Karra on this topic: "No one impresses me that much. People are just people... I've been in a lot of shower rooms and seen a lot of people naked. It's hard to see anyone as a god after you've seen them naked in the shower."
  - Focus on the positive. When that fails, think of those naked men in showers.
