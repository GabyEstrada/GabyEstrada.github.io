Built to Sell by John Warrillow

You should always run a company as if it will last forever, and yet you should also strive constantly to maximize its value, building in the qualities that allow it to be sold
at any moment for the highest price buyers are paying for businesses like yours.

Important notes:
- I want you to go away and think about what kind of projects you're really good at.
- System for creating logos, identify the steps
- what if you focused your business on just doing logos with the five-step logo design process?
- Ted's tip #1: don't generalize; specialize. If you focus on doing on thing well and hire specialists in that area, the quality of your work will improve
  and you will stand out among your competitors.
- if you want to sell your business, you should have a diverse group of clients where no one company makes up more than 10 to 15 percent of your revenue.
- ted's tip #2: relying too heavily on one client is risky and will turn off potential buyers. make sure than no one client makes up more than 15 percent of your revenue.
- in each business i've sold, we created a standard service offering, a consistent process for delivering our product or service. we made sure the product or service was something
- clients would need on a regular basis so we could count on reocurring revenue. I'm suggesting you become the world's best logo design shop. write your standard service offering.
- Create a one-page description of your approach to creating logos and find ten people to pitch it to. Come back next week and tell me how you made out.
- "We've designed a five-step processd for designing logos and have achieved some great results for clients.
- five-step logo design process
- Ted's tip #3: owning a process makes it easier to pitch and puts you in control. be clear about what you're selling, and potential customers will be more likely to buy your product.
- a service company is simply a collection of people with a specific expertise who offer their services to the marketplace
- tip #4: do not become synonymous with your company. if buyers arent't confident that your business can run without you in charge, they won't make their best offer.
- think of a model that allows you to charge in advance; this time make sure you include the price on the sell sheet and the words "billed upon signing letter of agreement". this is your product and you get to decide how it's billed
- ted's tip #5 avoid cash suck. onc eyou've standardized your service, charge up front or use progress billing to create a positive cash flow
- if you are the world's best logo creator, you;ll be memorable and referabble. foor every advertising project you turn down, you will win a logo assigment.
- teds top #6 dont be afraid to say no to projects. prove that you're serious about specialization by turning down wokr that falls outside your area of expertise/ the more people you say no to, the more referrals you'll get to people who need your product or service
- create an instruction manual; if he could get his staff to follow instructions, he could extricate himself from personally overseeing each new logo project
- to sell your business, you need to demonstrate to a buyer that you have a sales engine that will produce predictable, reocurring revenue
- ted's tip #7: take some time to figure out how many pipeline prospects will likely lead to sales. this number will become essential whn you go to sell because it allows the buyer to estimate the size of the market opportunity.
- always at least grab 2 sales people; salespeople are competitive and they will compete with each other
- know how many meetings to close a sale
- hire people who are good at selling products not services. these people will be better ablet o figure out how your product can meet a client's needs rather than agreeing to customize your offering to fit what the client wants
- you cant be 1/2 pregnant; old clients need to be told you dont do all now but specialize in x thing now and decline jobs!
- ig nore your p&L statement in the year you make the switch to a standardize offering even if it means you and your employees wikk gave to forgo a bonus that year. as long as your cash flow remains consistent and strong, you'll be back in the black in no time
- you need at least two years of finacial statements reflecting your use of the standardized offering model before you sell your company
- small biz sell for roughly 3x to 4x pretax profit
- when you want to sell your business, write in a paper what you want to sell it for, put it an envelope and forget it
- build a management team and offer them a long-term incentive plan that rewards their performance and loyalty
  - example: promotion with cash bonus plan (long-term incentive plan)
- the term business broker is usually used for individuals who do a smalles deals where the total value of the transaction is well under $5M. you are really looking for a boutique m&A firm. the firm you select needs to be large enough to be respected by a potential buyer, yet small enough that your deal will be important to them
- find an adviser for whom you will be neither their largest nor their smallest client. make sure they know your industry
- avoid an adviser who offers to a broker a discussion with a single client. you want to ensure there is competition for your business and avoid being used as a pawn for your adviser to curry favor with his or her best client.
