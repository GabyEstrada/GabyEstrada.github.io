Built to Sell by John Warrillow

You should always run a company as if it will last forever, and yet you should also strive constantly to maximize its value, building in the qualities that allow it to be sold
at any moment for the highest price buyers are paying for businesses like yours.

Important notes:
- I want you to go away and think about what kind of projects you're really good at.
- System for creating logos, identify the steps
- what if you focused your business on just doing logos with the five-step logo design process?
- Ted's tip #1: don't generalize; specialize. If you focus on doing on thing well and hire specialists in that area, the quality of your work will improve
  and you will stand out among your competitors.
- if you want to sell your business, you should have a diverse group of clients where no one company makes up more than 10 to 15 percent of your revenue.
- ted's tip #2: relying too heavily on one client is risky and will turn off potential buyers. make sure than no one client makes up more than 15 percent of your revenue.
- in each business i've sold, we created a standard service offering, a consistent process for delivering our product or service. we made sure the product or service was something
- clients would need on a regular basis so we could count on reocurring revenue. I'm suggesting you become the world's best logo design shop. write your standard service offering.
- Create a one-page description of your approach to creating logos and find ten people to pitch it to. Come back next week and tell me how you made out.
- "We've designed a five-step processd for designing logos and have achieved some great results for clients.
- five-step logo design process
- Ted's tip #3: owning a process makes it easier to pitch and puts you in control. be clear about what you're selling, and potential customers will be more likely to buy your product.
- a service company is simply a collection of people with a specific expertise who offer their services to the marketplace
- tip #4: do not become synonymous with your company. if buyers arent't confident that your business can run without you in charge, they won't make their best offer.
- think of a model that allows you to charge in advance; this time make sure you include the price on the sell sheet and the words "billed upon signing letter of agreement". this is your product and you get to decide how it's billed
- ted's tip #5 avoid cash suck. onc eyou've standardized your service, charge up front or use progress billing to create a positive cash flow
- if you are the world's best logo creator, you;ll be memorable and referabble. foor every advertising project you turn down, you will win a logo assigment.
- teds top #6 dont be afraid to say no to projects. prove that you're serious about specialization by turning down wokr that falls outside your area of expertise/ the more people you say no to, the more referrals you'll get to people who need your product or service
- create an instruction manual; if he could get his staff to follow instructions, he could extricate himself from personally overseeing each new logo project
- to sell your business, you need to demonstrate to a buyer that you have a sales engine that will produce predictable, reocurring revenue
