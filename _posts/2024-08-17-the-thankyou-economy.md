# "The Thank You Economy" by Gary Vaynerchuk

I rented this book from the library, but after reading it, I went ahead and ordered my own physical copy. I would say that this book summarizes how the "human" touch looked in the old days, how and when it was lost, and how it has come back again.

### Top things I learned:

- With social media, any business can connect on a 1:1 level with a customer.
- Tony Hsieh is an example of a great leader who cared about his clients, employees, and business.

### Culture building blocks:
- Begin with yourself.
- Commit wholeheartedly.
- Set the tone.
- Send a strong, direct message about your intent.
- Example of a style: personal, honest, and accommodating.
- Invest in employees.
- Trust your people.
- Be authentic.
- Interact with clients during both good and bad times.
  - "Thank you" "You're welcome"
  - "I'm sorry" "How can I fix the problem?" "Allow me."
- Utilize the "Ping-Pong" strategy.
  - Extend the conversation when you ask your clients to sign up on social media to receive a physical prize. Examples: Reebok, Denny's.
  - Layering social media on top of traditional media to extend the story is the most practical, executable, and measurable marketing move you can make today.
- Sticky stories are the ones that get carried forward, permeating the barrier around the middle and reaching far more people than you'll ever find in a limited space. See the graphic on page 181.

### One thing we can learn from Old Spice:

- Establish the brand with fantastic content.
- Extend the compelling story.

### Example of a letter from the heart:

- Tony Hsieh's letter to employees about the Zappos acquisition by Amazon.

If you are an entrepreneur, CEO, or marketer, I highly recommend reading this book. 

Cheers,
