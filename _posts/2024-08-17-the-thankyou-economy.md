# "The Thank You Economy" by Gary Vaynerchuk

I rented this book from the library but after reading, I went ahead and ordered my physical copy. This book is so hard to summarize the important points because I believe that evertyhing he says is important. 
He also provides a summary at then end of his book, so instead of stating my top points, I would say that this book show cases how the "human" touch looked in the old days, how and when was lost, and how it has come back again.
