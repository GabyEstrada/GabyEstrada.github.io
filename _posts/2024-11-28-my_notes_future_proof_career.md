# My Notes on "This Exercise Can Future-Proof Your Career" by Help Wanted [34-min podcast]

## Introduction
This is a short podcast that is life changing. I was finding myself on a situation where I work for a startup with the title of Customer Success Leader but do much more than just focus on Customer Success. I needed to find a way to place myself in a broader spectrum… for people to know that I knew more than just Customer Success. I know about operations, marketing, sales, branding, etc due to my vast experience in startups and helping businesses and solopreneurs with their problems. Hearing this podcast came like a perfect ring to my finger.

## The Golden Exercise
When you tie yourself to your job title, for example, “I’m a magazine editor” you are tying your identity to something that is changeable, something that is not future-proof. This makes you scared of layoffs. Your job could disappear or be replaced… and what do you do then?

Instead, come up with a mission statement for yourself.

- Rule #1: It has to be a short sentence
- Rule #2: It has to start with “I”
- Rule #3: Every word after that has to be carefully selected to ensure is not affected by time. Something that cannot be taken away from you. Something that has that feeling of “I have value no matter what changes in my life”.

## Examples
- “I tell stories in my own voice”
- “I help teams achieve greatness”
- “I solve the most complex problems”
- “We bring joy to people with sweet baked goods”
- “I help people become the best version of themselves”

They set resiliency.

## Conclusion
I would encourage to do two things:

1) Get a pen and a paper and do this exercise

2) Listen to the podcast where I learned this myself, here: https://open.spotify.com/episode/2SM0mVD9TXhNAvdRDY2URh?si=Qf5pFG6HSNiIU3zvhAKBdQ.
