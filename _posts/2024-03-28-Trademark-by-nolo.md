# Trademark (9th edition) by NOLO

This book was published in 2005 so there is some material that is outdated but for the most part there are great 
nuggets of information to store somewhere in our brain. Below are a few things that got stuck with me:

- Trade name: formal name of the business for purposes of bank accounts. creditors. and potential lawsuits
    - Example: The Goodnight Meat Company
- Trademark: name used to market business its goods and services
    - Example: "Sunrise Sausage" to identify a good produced by The Goodnight Meat Company
- The strongest trademark is a name coined (made up), such as Exxon
    - A unqiue name by nature is considered to be a distinctive name, and a distinctive name is entitled by law to
      protection as a trademark
- Weakest trademarks: descriptive names and most ordinary names unless it gains secondary meaning overtime
- Names to avoid: personal names, including nicknames, first names, surnames, and initials (there are more but these are the ones I cared about)
- When applying for a trademark, if you dont have enough money or want to be more
- Ideas for what counts as specimens for service marks: letter with the mark appearing and the services described... it could be a letter sent out to a lead
- Ideas for waht counts as a specimen for Marks on goods: JPEG of your website with domain name a prominent part of the design of the home page.
  - The services being offered on your website should match the description of the services in your application
- If you have not heard from the USPTO office in 6 months about the application... follow-up
- When your mark is federallu registered... add the Registration symbol sporatically with that word
- You can use TM (for trade mark) and SM ( for service mark) alongside an unregistered mark to show that you claim ownership of the mark and intend to assert your
  right against imitators
- During the 5th and 6th year after federally registering your mark, you should complete and file two PTO forms:
  - Section 8 Declaration
  - Section 15 Declaration
- If use mark for 5 years.. it will qualify for incontestable status
- Mantain tight control of your mark... police your trademark (you can hire a company to do this, etc)
  - If you discover someone else using your mark first send a letter protesting the use of the markand asserting claim of ownership
- Trasnferring ownership of the trademark... read pages 253-255
- Distinctive (or strong) slogans can be registed as trademarks with the PTO
  - Some slogans are inherently distinctive if by their very nature they create a memorable association with a particular product or service
    - Example: " Reach Out and Touch Someone" qualifies as it does not descrive the service
- Do a thorough reserach that the trademark you want to use is not in use.
    - Search state-registered trademarks and tradenames
    - lookup them up in the USPTO
    - Google
    - lookupnames that might sound or look alike and cause customer confusion
- George Eastman, founder of Kodak and a man with an eye for a good trademark, suggested that trademarks:
  - be short
  - be vigorous
  - be easily spelled, and
  - mean nothing
- Other trademark experts recommend that name marks be:
  - pronounceable
  - memorable
  - graphically attractive (for instance, no hyphens), and
  - legally available
- Fit your goods and services into the appropiate class
- Short on money and can't register multiple marks? Register the unadorned name first 
  - This gives the flexibility of using the name in many different configurations in the future without having to effect new registrations
  - Consider later registering the mark under more classes to increase the scope of protection as you spread into other classes
  - There is a diffrence between trademark and copyright
  - Trademark protects expression that is used to identify and distinguish a product or service in the marketplace

  Within each of these points, I could go deeper... but I will leave it to you as homework.

  Cheers,
  Gaby
