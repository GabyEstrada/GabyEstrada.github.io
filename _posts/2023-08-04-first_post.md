# What I Learned From "Enchanted" by Guy Kawasaki

### First, I loved how Guy wrote a book that is straight to the point while incorporating Japanese culture into it. 

### Now jumping into the lessons I learned: 
- When people thank you after you help them, the optimal response should be something along the lines of "I know you'd do the same for me"
- The ideal format of a presentation should be 10 slides, 20 minutes, using 30 point font
- When faced with an "enchanting" proposition, consider the following:
  - If I waited for a week, I'd still make the same decision
  - I've done my homework by reading reports and reviews of the product, service, organization, or idea
  - I'm fully aware of the total costs of this decision, including installation, support, maintenance, subscriptions, and upgrades
  - The decision will not harm people or the environment
  - The decision is not illegal, immoral, or unethical
  - If no one could see what I was doing, I would still do it
  - If everyone could see that I was doing this, I would still do it

 ### To understand fully what I'm talking about feel free to grab Guy's book at your nearest bookstore or online.

 Happy Reading,
