# What I Learned From "Enchanted" by Guy Kawasaki

### First, I loved how Guy wrote a book that is straight to the point while incorporating Japanese culture into it. 

### Now jumping into the lessons I learned: 
- When people thank you after you help them, the optimal response should be something along the lines of "I know you'd do the same for me"
- The ideal format of a presentation should be 10 slides, 20 minutes, using 30 point font
