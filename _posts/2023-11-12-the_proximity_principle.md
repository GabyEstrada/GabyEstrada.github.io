# The Proximity Principle by Ken Coleman

This book provides excellent, practical advice for those looking to
start, advance, or change their careers. Ken's insights, though seemingly common sense, 
serve as a valuable reminder to take the most direct route toward our goals. I highly recommend this book without hesitation.

Top points I want to remember:
- the right people + the right places = opps
- The Professors
  - Determine which people are good at teaching what you need to learn, then make a list of the classes or opps available both locally and nationally
- The Professionals
    - Reasearch the pros who excel your field -> decide who you want to connect -> identify alternative ways to learn from the pros you can't meet in person
- The Mentors
  - Think about what you want your career to look like in twenty years, then make a list of people you know whose professionals life matches your long-term career goals. Include why you admire them and how you
    want to be challenged by them or learn from them.
  - Determine what you want to learn from your potential mentor -> schedule a meeting
- The Peers
  - Do we share the same values? Do they challenge me to aim higher? Do they give honest feedback?
    - Now, write the five peers that you need to spend more time with 
- The Producers
  - Make a list of companies and orgs in desired field, then find out who the producers are
  - Determine exactly what you want to learn about their industry, then write down a few key questions you'd like tpo ask them
  - Schedule a brief meeting to learn about their industry
- Eerything you neeed can be found in your zipcode! Go and turn every rock.. you WILL find what you need!
- Create a web of connections... and when you do, add value
- Whatever role you have right now, do your best.. think of it as a cornerstone to your dream role
- mimic the pros in your field to then create your own style
- Keep your eyes out for producers who are maxed out, overworked, or in need of extra help
  - How might you step in to add value to their business or operation?
 
  This is an amazing book! This is one of the few ones I would actually recommend buying and keeping a had copy in your bookshelf!

  Happy Reading,
