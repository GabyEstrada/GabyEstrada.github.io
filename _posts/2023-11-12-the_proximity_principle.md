# "The Proximity Principle" by Ken Coleman

This book provides excellent and practical advice for those looking to
start, advance, or change their careers. Ken's insights, though seemingly common sense, 
serve as a valuable reminder to take the most direct route toward our goals. I highly recommend this book without hesitation.

### Top points I want to remember:
- The right people + the right places = opps
- The Professors
  - Determine which people are good at teaching what you need to learn, then make a list of the classes or opportunities available both locally and nationally
- The Professionals
    - Research the pros who excel in your field -> decide who you want to connect -> identify alternative ways to learn from the pros you can't meet in person
- The Mentors
  - Think about what you want your career to look like in twenty years, then make a list of people you know whose professionals life matches your long-term career goals. Include why you admire them and how you want to be challenged by them or learn from them.
  - Determine what you want to learn from your potential mentor -> schedule a meeting
- The Peers
  - Do we share the same values? Do they challenge me to aim higher? Do they give honest feedback?
    - Now, write the five peers that you need to spend more time with 
- The Producers
  - Make a list of companies and organizations in the desired field, then find out who the producers are
  - Determine exactly what you want to learn about their industry, then write down a few key questions you'd like to ask them
  - Schedule a brief meeting to learn about their industry
- Everything you need can be found in your zip code! Go and turn every rock... you WILL find what you need!
- Create a web of connections... and when you do, add value
- Whatever role you have right now, do your best.. think of it as a cornerstone to your dream role
- Mimic the pros in your field to then create your own style
- Keep your eyes out for producers who are maxed out, overworked, or in need of extra help
  - How might you step in to add value to their business or operation?
 
This is an amazing book! This is one of the few ones I would recommend buying and keeping a hard copy on your bookshelf!


  

Happy Reading,
