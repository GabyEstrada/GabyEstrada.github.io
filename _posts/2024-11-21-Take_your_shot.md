# "Take Your Shot" by Robin Waite

I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts when I came across an interview with Robin Waite, a career coach based in the UK. His insights during the episode left such a strong impression on me that I immediately decided to buy his book. It took me less than two hours to read, but the benefits I gained from it were absolutely incredible!

This is what I learned/liked:

- ‚ÄúLife is constantly in a state of stress. But, if you just carry on doing the same old thing nothing is ever going to change.‚Äù ‚Äì David
- Read: Napolean Hill‚Äôs Think and Grow Rich
- Before creating or fixing your business: Write a list of your one, three, five, and ten-year goals. No matter how big or small. But imagine where you want your life to be at each interval.
- Find your why, determine your purpose, and how you will achieve your purpose
  - Example from Russ:
    - Why: Family
    - Purpose: Golf; talents, passion, expertise, and even Russ‚Äô core values all based on the game of golf.
    - How: Get clients to turn up to every lesson and make sure they pay for them
  - My example:
    - Why: Family
    - Purpose: Business; I love anything related to learning or sharing about business stuff
    - How: Get clients to pay for my knowledge in business through mix of a one-time & subscription-based service models.
- Life without a clearly defined goal is nothing more than meaningless actions with no clear sense of direction!
  - Jumping from one activity to the next in a random order with no real sense of direction is not ideal.
  - Ask yourself ‚ÄúWill this activity take me closer to my main goal?
  - Trust your gut feeling
  - Don‚Äôt procrastinate. If you make decisions quickly and get it wrong, you can pivot and pull yourself back on track.
- Once you cut through the noise, it will be more easy to see:
  - What you goal is
  - How achievable it is
  - The activities required to achieve it
- A goal must be EXPLICIT and measured over a given length of time
- Sell a result not a product
- You need to lead the client and also (depending on the situation) leave them homework
- Your product must have a set of features which provide a guaranteed result for your clients
- You need to deliver a specific result, over a defined length of time, and the only way to guarantee that is to focus on one aspect of the game
- Why do clients want to focus on that area? Why they chose you?
  - Book example:
    - Because they want to enjoy the game more and get recognition for it
    - Because I can inspire them to drive to be the best golfer they can be. Show them what they can achieve.
- Focus on what your clients want
- You have to charge based on the value of the outcome you can deliver for your clients and incrementally add more value to provide a better-quality service and charge even more.
- Commit to a price and make offer to ten people and see how it goes
- Sign a contract that states each party‚Äôs responsibilities
- Have a simple, ten or less points assessment at the beginning and end of the course
- People can get to know you through videos, your website, events, and social media but they can‚Äôt like you or trust you until you have a 1:1 with them
- During the discovery call, asking the right questions is vital
- Once the product is delivered, you MUST have a follow-up process to ensure your client is happy for a period after you‚Äôve delivered the product to them
- For presentations‚Ä¶ take three deep breaths and don‚Äôt hide behind props but use them
  - Remember, that this is not about you but your audience

These are my takeaways from reading this short book. As always, read it on your own to get a complete picture. üç©‚òï
