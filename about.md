"In the Loren Eiseley tale 'The Star Thrower,' a traveler sees a man throwing starfish back into the sea to save them. He asks him why he thinks he can make a difference since there are thousands of starfish on the beach. He picks up another, throws it into the ocean, and says, 'IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO THAT ONE.'"
